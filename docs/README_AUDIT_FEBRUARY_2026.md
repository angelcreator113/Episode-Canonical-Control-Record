## 🎓 Key Lessons

1. **Never commit credentials** - Use .env.example only
2. **Git history is permanent** - Removing files doesn't erase history
3. **Always rotate exposed secrets** - Assume they were compromised
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Security is ongoing
5. **Organize as you go** - Technical debt accumulates fast
