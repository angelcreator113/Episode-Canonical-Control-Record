## 🚀 HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE

### Step 1: Review Documentation (15 minutes)
```bash
# Read in this order:
1. This file (YOU ARE HERE)
2. EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md (quick overview)
3. COVERAGE_ROADMAP.md (visual journey)
4. tests/integration/README.md (test details)
```

### Step 2: Run Integration Tests (30 minutes)
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "c:\Users\12483\prime studios\BRD\Episode-Canonical-Control-Record"

# Run tests
npm test -- tests/integration

# Generate coverage report
npm test -- tests/integration --coverage

# Expected: 430+ tests pass, coverage jumps to 79-81%
```

### Step 3: Add Edge Cases (2 hours)
```bash
# Review failing edge cases:
1. Open each controller test file
2. Add tests for edge cases identified
3. Target: +3-5pp additional coverage

# Result: 79-81% → 82-84% coverage
```

### Step 4: Polish to 75% (1 hour)
```bash
# Final verification:
1. Run full test suite with coverage
2. Identify any remaining gaps
3. Add targeted tests
4. Verify 75%+ threshold crossed

# Result: 75%+ LOCKED IN ✅
```

**Total Time: 3.5-4.5 hours to target**
