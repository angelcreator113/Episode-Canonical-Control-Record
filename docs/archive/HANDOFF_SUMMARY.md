## RDS Connection Details

**Save this information - you'll need it:**

```
Host:      episode-control-dev.csnow208wqtv.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Port:      5432
Database:  episode_metadata
User:      postgres
Password:  <REDACTED — see GitHub Actions secret DEV_DB_PASSWORD>
Engine:    PostgreSQL 14.7
```

Also available in:
- [.env](.env) as `DATABASE_URL`
- [rds-endpoints.txt](rds-endpoints.txt) (will be created after migrations)

---

## Cognito Connection Details

**Dev User Pool:**
- Pool ID: `us-east-1_mFVU52978`
- Client ID: `lgtf3odnar8c456iehqfck1au`
- Test Users: admin@episodeidentityform.com, editor@episodeidentityform.com, viewer@episodeidentityform.com

## What Needs to Happen Next (In Order)

### Immediate (Next 5 minutes):
```bash
npm run migrate           # Phase 1A: Migrations
powershell verify-database.ps1  # Verify schema
npm test                 # Phase 1E: Test validation
```

### Short-term (After migrations pass):
- [ ] Review test results
- [ ] Document any schema changes
- [ ] Commit infrastructure setup to git
- [ ] Begin Phase 1F (API Documentation)

### Medium-term:
- [ ] Create staging RDS instance (currently not created)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [ ] Deploy to development environment
- [ ] Complete Phase 1G (Performance optimization)

---

## Emergency Contacts / Resources

**If migrations fail:**
1. Check RDS status: `aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier episode-control-dev --region us-east-1`
2. Verify .env DATABASE_URL is correct
3. Confirm npm dependencies: `npm list node-pg-migrate`
4. See [RDS_READY_FOR_MIGRATIONS.md](RDS_READY_FOR_MIGRATIONS.md) troubleshooting section

**If tests won't connect:**
1. Update [tests/setup.js](tests/setup.js) to use .env DATABASE_URL
2. Ensure NODE_ENV is not forcing test database
3. Check security group allows your IP on port 5432
