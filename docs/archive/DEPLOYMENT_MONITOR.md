## Check Deployment Status

Go to: https://github.com/angelcreator113/Episode-Canonical-Control-Record/actions

Look for the "Deploy to Development" workflow that was triggered by your latest push (commit `ceec1fb`).

## What's Happening Now

Your push to `dev` automatically triggered the deployment workflow which will:
1. ✅ Run tests
2. ✅ Build frontend with **improved cache clearing** (your latest changes)
3. ✅ Deploy to EC2
4. ✅ Restart PM2

The deployment script now includes:
```bash
rm -rf dist node_modules .vite .env.local .env.production.local .env.development.local
rm -rf node_modules/.vite node_modules/.cache  # ← NEW: More aggressive cache clearing
```

## Wait for Deployment to Complete

The deployment takes about 5-10 minutes. Watch the GitHub Actions page for:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Success
- ❌ Red X = Failed (check logs)

## After Deployment Completes

1. **Hard refresh your browser**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. **Check the site**: https://dev.primepisodes.com
3. **Verify in DevTools**:
   - Open Network tab (F12)
   - Refresh
   - All `/assets/*.js` should be **200 OK** with `Content-Type: application/javascript`

## If You Still See Issues After Deployment

Then you'll need to SSH to the server for manual intervention:

### Find Your EC2 Host
The EC2 hostname/IP should be in your GitHub repository secrets as `EC2_HOST`.

Check your deployment workflow file or GitHub Settings → Secrets for the actual hostname.

It's likely something like:
- `ec2-X-X-X-X.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
- Or an IP like `3.94.166.174` (the one in your deployment script)

### SSH Command (Once You Have the Host)
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR_ACTUAL_EC2_HOST
```

Or if you have the key in GitHub secrets, you may need to set it up locally first.

## Current Status

✅ Code pushed to dev
✅ Deployment triggered automatically
⏳ Waiting for GitHub Actions to complete
🎯 After deployment completes: Hard refresh browser

**Next Step**: Monitor the GitHub Actions page and wait for the green checkmark!
